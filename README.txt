CODILITY
————————

The repo is for the solutions of the problems in the Codility platform. Generally, Codility
problems are formed with more than one arguments and helps to improve the abstract thinking.
However, unless specified, these problems may not be suitable to prepare for the general
coding interviews.

I haven't write the solutions and are primarily collected for the educational purpose.
However, I refactored the code and changed the logic if necessary. Occasionally, I don't
find the solutions over online and write them myself. Obviously, These solutions are free
to use. I will attain some tournament and update the repo overtime.


Geeks for geeks: The is collected for the educational purpose from their website.

Project Euler: The is collected for the educational purpose.
